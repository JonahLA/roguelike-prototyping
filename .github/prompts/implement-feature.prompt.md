Review the assigned portion of the implementation plan. 
Ask any clarifying questions. 
Review the existing scripts to know what you can leverage for the implementation and what you need you to build.
Create a plan for how you will implement the feature. 
When you begin implementing a portion of the implementation plan, mark that section of the implementation plan as "In Progress" directly in the document.
When you finish implementing a portion of the implementation plan, remove the "In Progress" tag and check off the check box for the step(s) you completed.
