Flare - Prototype
This project involves prototyping a 2D top-down card-based roguelike game where players collect and upgrade cards to perform attacks and abilities, progress through stages, and engage in boss battles. Meta progression tracks the player's decisions throughout the run, affecting the final ending and boss encounter.

Project Context
Players utilize a deck of cards to trigger various attacks and abilities. Key mechanics include:
- Card-based attacks and abilities that can be collected, upgraded, and strategically used.
- Boss battles and stage progression to challenge the player.
- Meta progression which records the player's good/bad decisions to determine the ending and final boss.

Development Environment
Language: C#
Unity Version: 6.1

Project Instructions
- Ensure the game mechanics are intuitive and responsive.
- Develop a modular code structure to facilitate easy updates and maintenance.
- Optimize performance for smooth, real-time gameplay.
- Implement a robust tracking system for player decisions to influence game outcomes.
- Maintain clean, well-documented, and testable code.

Additional Notes
This project is in the prototyping phase focusing on mechanics and implementations. Feel free to ask questions if you need more information or have suggestions for further improvements.
