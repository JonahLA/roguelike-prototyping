- [x] Support for different damage types (normal, critical, healing)
- [x] Proper TextMeshPro integration with sorting layers
- [x] Pool return system for performance

### Damage Number Spawning âœ…
- [x] `DamageNumberSpawner.cs` - Pool management system
- [x] Singleton pattern for easy access from anywhere
- [x] Configurable pool size and spawn settings
- [x] Static convenience methods for spawning
- [x] Position variance and height offset configuration
- [x] Performance optimization with object pooling

### UI Integration âœ…
- [x] `HealthDisplay.cs` - Heart-based health visualization
- [x] Support for full, half, and empty heart sprites
- [x] Event-driven updates from Health component
- [x] Smooth animations for damage/healing
- [x] Dynamic heart creation based on max health
- [x] Editor preview functionality for design iteration

## Next Steps

### Step 2: Player Combat Foundation (âœ… Implemented)
- [x] Create `IPlayerAttack` interface and attack strategy architecture
- [x] Implement `SwordSwingAttack.cs` as the primary melee attack (`SwordSwingAttackSO.cs`)
- [x] Create `PlayerCombat.cs` for input handling and attack coordination
- [x] Integrate with existing PlayerMovementController

### Step 3: Enemy AI and Behavior (âœ…)
- [x] **Phase 1: Core Structures**
  - [x] Create `EnemyAIState` enum
  - [x] Create `EnemyStatsSO` ScriptableObject
  - [x] Create base `ScriptableObject` strategy interfaces (`TargetingStrategySO`, `MovementStrategySO`, `AttackStrategySO`)
  - [x] Create `Enemy.cs` MonoBehaviour
- [x] **Phase 2: Concrete Strategies**
  - [x] Implement `WanderTargetingStrategy`
  - [x] Implement `PursuePlayerTargetingStrategy`
  - [x] Implement `WalkMovementStrategy`
  - [x] Implement `MeleeAttackStrategy`
- [x] **Phase 3: AI Coordinator**
  - [x] Implement `EnemyAI.cs` to manage states and execute strategies
  - [x] Add player detection logic (line-of-sight, range)
  - [x] Implement state transition logic (Passive <-> Pursuing <-> Attacking)
- [x] **Phase 4: Integration**
  - [x] Connect AI to `Health` component for death handling
  - [x] Integrate attack strategy with player's `IDamageable` interface
  - [X] Create a basic "Grunt" enemy prefab with all components configured
  - [X] Fix issue with not being able to hit "Grunt" with an attack

### Step 4: Room Integration and Polish (ðŸ”„ In Progress)

**Current Analysis:**
- âœ… Health system provides centralized death events via `HealthManager`
- âœ… Enemy AI system is complete with death handling
- âœ… Room system exists with `NormalRoom`, `DoorController`, and templates
- âœ… `RoomContentPopulator` exists for enemy spawning functionality
- âœ… Enemy spawn points defined in `RoomTemplate` system

**Implementation Plan:**

**Phase 1: Core Room Integration**
- [X] Enhance `NormalRoom` to subscribe to enemy death events from `HealthManager.EntityDeath`
- [X] Implement enemy tracking system to monitor spawned enemies
- [X] Add door locking/unlocking mechanics using existing `DoorController.Lock()/Unlock()` methods
- [X] Connect `NormalRoom` with `RoomContentPopulator` for enemy spawning

**Phase 2: Enemy Spawning Logic**
- [X] Spawn enemies on first room entry if room not cleared
- [X] Track spawned enemies for room clear detection
- [X] Handle room clear condition and door unlocking
- [X] Integrate with existing `isCleared` flag system

**Phase 3: Visual Polish**
- [X] Create basic enemy death particle effects system
- [X] Integrate particle effects with enemy death events

**Phase 4: Testing & Polish**
- [X] Test room clearing mechanics with existing enemy prefabs
- [X] Verify door locking/unlocking works correctly
- [ ] Performance testing with multiple enemies

**Clarifying Questions & Decisions:**
1.  **Enemy Spawning Timing**: Spawn on room creation or first player entry?
    - **Decision**: Enemies will spawn on the player's first entry into a room.
2.  **Room State Persistence**: Should cleared rooms stay cleared when revisited?
    - **Decision**: Yes, cleared rooms will remain cleared.
3.  **Difficulty Integration**: Use existing difficulty system or default values?
    - **Decision**: We will implement a player-driven **Risk/Reward System** for difficulty. Room challenge will be determined by the hand-crafted enemy compositions in `RoomTemplate` assets, not a scaling difficulty parameter.
4.  **Particle Effects Scope**: Generic system or enemy-type-specific effects?
    - **Decision**: A generic, robust particle system will be implemented for enemy deaths and potentially other future effects.
5.  **Door Locking Behavior**: Lock all doors or only exit doors when enemies present?
    - **Decision**: All doors will lock when enemies are present.

### Step 5: Visual Polish (Not Started)
- [X] Add particle effects for enemy death
- [X] Implement damage number spawning
- [ ] Create attack effect visualization

### Step 99: TECH DEBT - to do later
- [ ] Add visual feedback for room clearing

## Testing & Integration Notes

### Created Components Ready for Testing:
1. **Health.cs** - Can be added to any GameObject to provide health functionality
2. **DamageNumberSpawner.cs** - Should be added to a scene GameObject (becomes singleton)
3. **HealthDisplay.cs** - Can be added to UI Canvas for health visualization

### Next Integration Steps:
1. Add Health component to Player prefab
2. Create DamageNumber prefab with TextMeshPro
3. Set up UI Canvas with HealthDisplay for player health
4. Test damage/healing functionality with debug methods

### Architecture Decisions Made:
- Used both UnityEvents and C# events for maximum flexibility
- Implemented IDamageable interface for modular damage system
- Created singleton DamageNumberSpawner for performance and ease of use
- Designed HealthDisplay to work with any Health component via events
- Built comprehensive pooling system for damage numbers
- Added extensive editor tools for testing and iteration

The Core Health System is now complete and ready for integration testing!
