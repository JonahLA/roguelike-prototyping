# Progress: Player Setup

Tracking the current status of the Player Setup feature from the implementation plan.

- [X] Create Player prefab with placeholder sprite
- [X] Add and configure SpriteRenderer, Rigidbody2D, and Collider2D components
- [X] Implement `PlayerMovementController` script for movement input and physics
- [X] Set up orthographic camera and follow behavior (Cinemachine or custom)
- [X] Playtest movement in an empty scene and verify responsiveness

## Developer Notes and Settings
- Player Rigidbody2D:
  - Body Type: Dynamic with Z Rotation frozen to constrain movement to X/Y plane.
  - Interpolation: Set to "Interpolate" (or "Extrapolate") to smooth physics updates and eliminate camera jitter.
- CameraFollow.cs (Assets/Scripts/CameraFollow.cs):
  - Attached to Main Camera, uses `LateUpdate` and `Vector3.SmoothDamp` (smoothTime ≈ 0.2f) while locking the Z position.
  - Ensure the Player transform is assigned in the inspector before Play Mode.
- Jitter Fix:
  - Enabling Rigidbody2D interpolation is sufficient to remove edge-of-deadzone camera jitter.
- Production Migration Tips:
  - Switch to Cinemachine Virtual Camera for built-in dead-zone, damping, and composer features:
    1. Install via Package Manager → "Cinemachine".
    2. Create a Cinemachine Virtual Camera and set its "Follow" target.
    3. Adjust Body → Transposer dead-zone and damping parameters.
  - Replace placeholder sprites and prefabs with polished assets and animations.
