# Enemy Spawning & Combat Implementation Progress

## Step 1: Core Health System ✅

### Health Component (`Health.cs`) ✅
- [x] Float-based health (0.0-5.0 for hearts) with event broadcasting
- [x] IDamageable interface implementation for modular design
- [x] Immunity frames and damage validation
- [x] Death handling with event broadcasting
- [x] Health-to-hearts conversion utilities for UI
- [x] Healing methods (Heal, FullHeal)
- [x] Max health configuration with proportional scaling
- [x] Editor debug methods for testing
- [x] Both UnityEvents and C# events for flexible subscription
- [x] **Event-based architecture with HealthManager integration**
- [x] **Automatic damage number spawning on damage/healing**

### Event System ✅
- [x] **`HealthManager.cs` - Centralized health event broadcasting**
- [x] **Player-specific health events for UI integration**
- [x] **Entity health events for general game systems**
- [x] **Death event broadcasting for game state management**

### Visual Feedback System ✅
- [x] `DamageNumber.cs` - Individual damage number behavior with animation
- [x] Configurable animation curves for movement and fade
- [x] Support for different damage types (normal, critical, healing)
- [x] Proper TextMeshPro integration with sorting layers
- [x] Pool return system for performance

### Damage Number Spawning ✅
- [x] `DamageNumberSpawner.cs` - Pool management system
- [x] Singleton pattern for easy access from anywhere
- [x] Configurable pool size and spawn settings
- [x] Static convenience methods for spawning
- [x] Position variance and height offset configuration
- [x] Performance optimization with object pooling

### UI Integration ✅
- [x] `HealthDisplay.cs` - Heart-based health visualization
- [x] Support for full, half, and empty heart sprites
- [x] **Event-driven updates from HealthManager (no direct component references)**
- [x] Smooth animations for damage/healing
- [x] Dynamic heart creation based on max health
- [x] Editor preview functionality for design iteration
- [x] **Automatic player discovery and health state initialization**

### Step 2: Player Combat Foundation
- [X] Create `IPlayerAttack` interface and attack strategy architecture
- [X] Implement `SwordSwingAttack.cs` as the primary melee attack
- [X] Create `PlayerCombat.cs` for input handling and attack coordination
- [X] Integrate with existing PlayerMovementController

### Step 3: Enemy AI and Behavior
- [X] Implement strategy interfaces (`ITargetingStrategy`, `IMovementStrategy`, `IAttackStrategy`)
- [X] Create basic concrete strategies (wander, pursue, walk, melee)
- [X] Implement `EnemyAI.cs` state coordinator with strategy composition
- [X] Add player detection and damage dealing

### Step 4: Room Integration and Polish
- [X] Enhance `NormalRoom` with enemy tracking via death events
- [X] Implement door locking/unlocking mechanics
- [X] Add particle effects for enemy death

### Step 5: Visual Polish
- [X] Add particle effects for enemy death
- [X] Implement damage number spawning
- [X] Create attack effect visualization

### Step 99: Tech debt / next steps
- [ ] Write documentation on how to implement each system into the scene
    - Write as Markdown docs in the `Docs` directory
- [ ] Fix issue of damage particles not being returned to the `VFXSpawner`
- [ ] Make other basic enemy prefabs with unique strategy configurations
- [ ] Create bosses

## Testing & Integration Notes

### Created Components Ready for Testing:
1. **Health.cs** - Can be added to any GameObject to provide health functionality
2. **DamageNumberSpawner.cs** - Should be added to a scene GameObject (becomes singleton)
3. **HealthDisplay.cs** - Can be added to UI Canvas for health visualization

### Next Integration Steps:
1. Add Health component to Player prefab
2. Create DamageNumber prefab with TextMeshPro
3. Set up UI Canvas with HealthDisplay for player health
4. Test damage/healing functionality with debug methods

### Architecture Decisions Made:
- Used both UnityEvents and C# events for maximum flexibility
- Implemented IDamageable interface for modular damage system
- Created singleton DamageNumberSpawner for performance and ease of use
- **Designed event-based architecture with HealthManager for loose coupling**
- **HealthDisplay works independently without direct Health component references**
- Built comprehensive pooling system for damage numbers
- Added extensive editor tools for testing and iteration
- **Integrated automatic damage number spawning directly into Health system**

The Core Health System is now complete and ready for integration testing!
